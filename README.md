# CarboLeon - introduction 

Hi !

This is our project CarboLeon !

We have made it for *"[Zwolnieni z Teorii](https://zwolnienizteorii.pl/)"* competition, and now we want to make it opensource !

If you want to see how the website looks simply go to [https://carboleon.eu/](https://carboleon.eu/).
If you would like to use our project or you just want to play with it simply add .env file with two variables that contains API keys:
    **REACT_APP_API_KEY_OPENWEATHER**     AND      
    **REACT_APP_API_KEY_WAQI**

We used apis form:
    [**OpenWeather**](https://openweathermap.org/) and 
    [**WAQI**](https://waqi.info/)

As it is a react app, you must remember to download all the dependecies and node modules.
