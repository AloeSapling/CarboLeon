# CarboLeon - introduction 

Hello !

This is quick documentation about our social project CarboLeon.

If you read this, our website's code is open source and free to use !

So, quick sum up of files, and project.
Whole website is about showing people air pollution, we used [openstreet map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) to show this pollution on the map.
We also provide info about weather, temperature and some additional info about air pollution.

Now, it's time to showcase the files !

[Index.js](https://github.com/AloeSapling/CarboLeon/blob/master/src/index.js)

As you can know Index.js is pretty basic thing for react apps. It's just a root for our whole app.

[i18next.js](https://github.com/AloeSapling/CarboLeon/blob/master/src/i18next.js)

i18next.js is script that handles our translation from english to polish, or reversed. i18next is react node package for react that has some addtional react hooks.

[App.js](https://github.com/AloeSapling/CarboLeon/blob/master/src/App.js)

In this file we made router, that loads other components.
We also used **lazy loading**.
