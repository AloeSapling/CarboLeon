        "Text": "Carboleon is a website whose purpose is to show and educate about the global and local situation of air pollution. Thanks to the hard work and commitment of the development team, this goal has not only been fulfilled, but also expanded to provide knowledge about more then just air pollution! Now, alongside a pollution map that's easy to read and use, the website also features a weather index. To help the site function, it uses various API's including 'openstreetmap', 'leaflet', 'waqi' and 'openweather'. The project is for a polish national competition called 'Zwolnieni z Teorii' and is funded by it's sponsor: 'e-tronix.pl', 'oko-design'. Check out our social media's to find more interesting content related to our cause!",

        "what":"Air pollution is the contamination of air by pollutants. Pollutants are particles that change the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Here we can specifically mention inhalable particles, composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust or water. These are also called “particulate matter”(PM). PM can be of different sizes and is generally defined by their aerodynamic diameter, with PM2.5 and PM10 the most common in the regulatory framework and relevant for health.",
        "why": "Lots of people suffer from air pollution and even unknowingly, you might be one of them! A large part of the world doesn’t understand the significance of this. 7 million - that’s the amount of people who die PREMATURELY due to air pollution and its effects. It’s very likely that contaminated air is a large contributor to elderly people’s deaths as well. Just like with many cancers it's hard to find out that you are suffering from air pollution in the early stages, a part of this is because it literally causes lung cancer and other illnesses such as: strokes, heart diseases, acute and chronic respiratory diseases.  For all of the fatal effects of contaminated air, it’s hard to figure out the reason for the diseases, as well as the symptoms being unnoticeable, nonexistent or resembling that of common diseases until it’s too late…",
        "wFight": "In terms of fighting air pollution the best thing you can do is inform others of the problem, petition against removal of CO2 removing objects(e.g. Forests or other plants) and donate to charities that plant more plants. Although, fighting air pollution is only half the problem… A good idea is to fight against the rise of air pollution - getting rid of or limiting sources of air pollution around you can help everyone out significantly. An important part to remember is that whilst groups can cause change and individuals can’t, groups of individuals can! There could be a potential group of hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of individuals that will never come into existence, because everyone of them decides it’s pointless. Start the cycle and stand up for something - if more people do the same thing, that’s when change can happen. For the things you can do individually is switch out your mode of transport to one that’s more CO2 efficient like trains, buses, bikes (and if that’s not possible switching to hybrid or electric cars are a step in the right direction), switch out your home heating to gas or electric, be careful of which companies you support - just buying companies products counts as supporting them, which means buying from companies that are involved with air pollution contributes to it.",
        "good": "Well, your city/area isn’t very polluted, so there is not much you can do to protect yourself, as the isn’t much to protect yourself from (at least in terms of air pollution). You should be happy and grateful that you and/or your city/country officials and/or your coresidents of the city are keeping the area’s air pretty clean.",
        "fine": "Your city/area isn’t that polluted. You shouldn’t have to worry about air pollution too much. If you are experiencing lung problems you may want to contact a doctor or buy an air purifier/start wearing a mask.",
        "worse": "Your city/area is pretty polluted. You should start considering wearing a mask and/or switching to greener ways of living and/or  buying an air purifier (if you have the money to do so) as well as considering going to a doctor. Try taking the bus or riding a bike to work/school.",
        "bad": "Your city/area’s pollution levels are higher than they should be - which is bad. Just like in the situation of worse levels of air pollution, you should consider wearing a mask and/or switching to greener ways of living and/or  buying an air purifier (if you have the money to do so). Another thing you should consider is talking to your friends, neighbors and/or family about air pollution and what they can do to protect themselves/limit it. Try regularly taking the bus or riding a bike to work/school.",
        "vbad": "Your city/area is suffering from air pollution. It is recommended you wear a mask and switch to greener ways of living. Inform others in your city/area of the problem. If you are experiencing signs of lung or heart problems/pain and/or constant headaches/migraines, you should go see a doctor. You might consider taking regular doctor’s appointments. Limit staying around areas with smoke or other forms of pollution, if that’s not possible try to refrain from inhaling it. The smog can have a very negative effect on your mental health, so try not getting depressed or developing other mental illnesses. If it’s possible, consider moving out.",
        "ebad": "Your city/area is greatly suffering from air pollution. It is very recommended to wear a mask, stay green, inform others of the terrible situation and get into contact with a doctor if you experience any of the following: extensive amounts of coughing, constant migraines, heart/chest pains, general weakness of the body/limbs. It is also recommended to have regular doctor’s appointments. The smog can have a very negative effect on your mental health, so try not getting depressed or developing other mental illnesses. You should take into great consideration moving out if possible."
